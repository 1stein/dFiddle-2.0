# dFiddle

### What is it?

A cut down version of [Durandal], hosted as Github repo with only one gh-pages branch.

### What is it good for?

JSFiddle et al. are all great when there's a need to fiddling with CSS/JavaScript/HTML snippets or 
sharing code during discussions on stackoverflow or newsgroups. 

Unfortunately, due to the nature of Durandal that encourage you to break down apps in many smaller modules and then use 
 [composition] to stitch them back together, those apps are no longer at their sweet spot. because there's no easy way to 
deal with multiple smaller external files.

**dFiddle** to the rescue.

### How to use?


+ Step 1: Fork the repo (hint there's a fork button in the upper right) 
+ Step 2: To get you started there are 3 fiddles under `App/fiddles`. Use github's online editor to modify them `https://github.com/Your_User_Name/Durandal-Fiddle/App/fiddles`.
+ Step 3: Once you make your first commit the live version will become available at an URL like  `http://Your_User_Name.github.io/Durandal-Fiddle`. According to github it might take up to **ten minutes** for changes to be visible.


Once you nailed your fiddle 

+ share links to the the live version e.g. `http://Your_User_Name.github.io/Durandal-Fiddle#/fiddles/fiddle-01`
+ share links right down to a specific code line e.g. `https://github.com/Your_User_Name/Durandal-Fiddle/blob/gh-pages/App/fiddles/fiddle-01/index.html#L4`



Happy fiddling,

Rainer
